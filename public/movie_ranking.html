    <h1>The Best Movies According To Me</h1>
    <h2>My top 5 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>The Martian (2015)</h3>
    <p>This one is one of my favourite movie. I really like the acting of Matt Damon.And the VFX <br /> is so real that I felt like the movie is actually shot in the Mars.</p>

    <h3>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)</h3>
    <p>This movie is a remarkable cinematic masterpiece that pushesh the boundries of animation <br /> and storytelling. </p> 


    <h3>Inception (2010)</h3>
    <p>Inception is such a mind-blowing, storytelling masterpiece and Christopher Nolan's #1 film <br /> while also being one of the greatest science fiction action movies ever made.</p>

    <h3>Avatar (2009)</h3>
    <p>This is unlike any kind of adventure movie my eyes have ever seen in such a long time, <br />the characters, the musical score for every scene, the story, the beauty of the landscapes of <br />Pandora, the rich variety and uniqueness of the flora and fauna of Pandora, the ways and<br /> cultures and language of the natives of Pandora, everything about this movie I am beyond <br />impressed and truly captivated by.</p>

    <h3>Avengers: Endgame (2019)</h3>
    <p>
Avengers endgame is hands down the best superhero film ever<br /> made. Yes, I enjoyed endgame more than Infinity war, Into the<br /> spider verse, Batman Begins, and Dark knight rises.<br /> Even though movies like Infinity war had more action and<br /> more battles between the heroes and the villains,<br /> endgame gives just enough action for the movie to not feel<br /> boring but also doesn't overload you with endless<br /> action sequences without focusing on a coherent<br /> story.</p>
